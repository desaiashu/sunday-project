## Layout

- `Untitled.bird` — arrangement & musical intent, human-readable.
- `entities/` — content keyed by stable id (clips, plugins, automation, channels). Each file stays whole until it grows large, then transparently shards into `entities/<type>/NN.json` so merges stay size-independent.
- `spaces/` — projections that place entities (arrangement rows, mixer bus) plus per-user workspaces under `spaces/users/<id>.json` (open tabs, active tab, playback scope).
- `state/` — global project state (transport, settings, sections, …).
- `samples/` & `visuals/` — media payloads, stored in R2 (see `manifest.json`).
